# NodeJS-Express-Weather-App

Create a NodeJS express weather application that obtains weather data for Campbell, CA, Omaha, NE, Austin, TX and Timonium, MD. Display the weather results in a table and omit any locations that fail to return data.

Create a middleware on the server‐side that will log to the console all parameters passed to the server via different methods of inputting data from a web app to the server (form, URL, etc). For example, if the URL was http://localhost:8000/weather?name=foo it would log the fact that the name=foo was passed.
